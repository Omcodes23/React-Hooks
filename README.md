## Introduction

React hooks are a powerful way to manage state and side effects in functional components. This project provides a set of commonly used hooks, as well as some custom hooks that can be used in your React applications. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced React developer, these hooks can help streamline your development process.

## Usage

To use the hooks in your React application, you can import them like this:

```

Once you've imported the hooks, you can use them in your functional components just like any other React hook.

## Available Hooks

### Basic Hooks

1. **useState**: A basic state management hook that allows you to manage and update component state.

2. **useEffect**: A basic side-effect hook that lets you perform side effects in your functional components.

### Custom Hooks

1. **useEffectWidth**: A custom hook that extends `useEffect` to trigger side effects when the width of the window matches a specified value.

2. **useStateArray**: A custom hook for managing an array in state, with functions for adding, removing, and updating elements within the array.
